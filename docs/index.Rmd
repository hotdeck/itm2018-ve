# The VETravelDemandMM module

- Started in 2015 as an Oregon DOT SPR project to better capture mode shifting for the Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM) tool to
    - Incorporate non-auto modes into a mode choice module for the RSPM tool;
    - Explore and utilize the best data sources available for model estimation;
    - Leverage this effort for additional research and expand the scope to include emerging modes (bike sharing, car sharing, shared automated vehicles).

# Progress

- Orginally planned to be implemented for the original RSPM/GreenSTEP (ver 3.5)
- Modes/models included:
    - Annual Average Daily Vehicle Models Travelled (VMT) model
    - Transit trips (frequency and length) and Person Miles Travelled (PMT)
    - Biking trips and PMT
    - Walking trips and PMT
- Products (so far):
    - Project working papers and report deliverables
    - A poster presentation at the 2018 TRB annual meeting
    - A manuscript under review for publication at the Journal of Transport and Land Use

# Innovations

- Utilizing a novel dataset of highly detailed information of households (2009 NHTS) and built environment (EPA Smart Location Database) with a US nationwide coverage;
- Modeling annual average daily Vehicle Miles Traveled (AADVMT), instead of the VMT during the day of the survey commonly used in similar models;
- Use of cross validation in model development to avoid overfitting;
- Conducting model selection, in addition to variable selection, in the model development process to select the best model structure among a handful of options;
- Implemented in the popular statistical programming language R as a self-contained package, which contains documents and functions for model (re-)estimation and prediction;
- The model development process, from data processing, model estimation, validation and testing, to report and document compiling, follows the best practices of reproducible research; results and products derived from our work, including this ITM paper/presentation, is fully reproducible by others (sans confidential data).

# Elasticities

<!-- I'm not going to show you the usual model estimation results etc here, but just to showcase two examples where I think the new implementation has done a good job -->

# VisionEval Framework

- When the project started, VisionEval (formerly RSPM Framework) was still on the drawing board;
- As VE development picked up steam and materialized, the project team and TAC decided that it made more sense to implement for VE instead;
- Started swtiching to implement as a VE module package in 12/2016;
- Amended the Scope of Work to include the contribution review in 02/2017

# VETravelDemandMM Implementation

- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/cities-lab/VETravelDemandMM
- A standard R package with
    - inst/extdata - external datasets (HPMS, NTD, Place Types etc; 2009 NTHS and SLD are dependencies as separate packages)
    - data-raw/ - scripts for model estimation; can be adapted for re-estimating models with new data
    - data/ - estimated R model objects
    - R/ - implementation of the module
    - man/ - manuals for functions implemented in the package
    - vignettes/ - vignettes (documents) for the package, including an introduction document, contribution review and feedback
    - test/ - tests that are automatically with travis-ci [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cities-lab/VETravelDemandMM.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cities-lab/VETravelDemandMM)

# Reflections

- The modular VE framework, along with the design principle, sample modules, extensive documentation and coding style guide, is extremely helpful;
- Best practices we follow (mostly blessings to our team) and facilitate incorporating our code with the VE code base:
  - Code organization as R package
  - The git/GitHub workflow
  - Automated tests and continous integration
  - Reproducible research practice
- Working closely with VE core developers like Brian Gregor and myself being part of the team that helped devising the review criteria helped;
- Bridging the gap between transportation research and professional practice and leveraging SPR/UTC funding
